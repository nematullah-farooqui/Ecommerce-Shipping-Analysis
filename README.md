# üö® E-commerce Shipping Crisis Analysis

## üìã Project Overview
An e-commerce company is facing severe **delivery performance issues** that threaten both customer retention and business survival.  
- **40% of shipments arrive late**  
- **Customer satisfaction critically low (2.99 / 5)**  

This analysis uncovers the **root causes** and provides a roadmap for **operational transformation**.

## üîë Core Crisis
The **priority shipping system** is failing:  
- Only a **6% improvement** for high-importance shipments  
- All service levels perform **~30% below industry standards**  
- Even critical deliveries face a **35% late rate** ‚Üí unacceptable risk for key customers

5. Does the company need optimization or **complete transformation**?

## üìà Key Findings

### 1. Overall Performance
| Metric                 | Value                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| On-time Delivery Rate   | 59.66% (6,563 / 10,999)  |
| Late Delivery Rate      | 40.34% (4,436 shipments) |
| Customer Satisfaction   | 2.99 / 5 (Critical level)|

‚û°Ô∏è **Industry Benchmark:** 90%+ on-time is expected; <80% threatens survival.

### 2. The Priority System Illusion
| Product Importance | On-time Rate | Late Rate | "Improvement" |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| High Importance    | 65%          | 35%       | +6%           |
| Medium Importance  | 59%          | 41%       | Baseline      |
| Low Importance     | 59%          | 41%       | Baseline      |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Insight:** The system creates a *false sense of security*. High-value shipments still fail **35% of the time**.
